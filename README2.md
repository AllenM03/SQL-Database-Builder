# Employee Productivity Watcher

## Description
Employee Tracker is a command-line application, used  to manage a company's employee database. It allows the user to easily store employee information such as the name of the employee, departments, and roles. This application uses a CRUD operation and is created in MySQL by creating a simple content management system, and since it only functions on the command-line on Node.js there is no front end service.
